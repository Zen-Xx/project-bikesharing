# project-bikesharing

Imagine that you own a bikesharing company. You want to predict how many bikes you need because if you have too few you're loosing money from potential riders. You are wasting money on bikes that are just sitting around. So you need to predict from historical data how many bikes you'll need in the future

To do this we'll use a simple two layer neural network.

The data comes from the [UCI Machine Learning Database](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset)

#### The files in repository are -

* project_bikesharing.ipynb - Jupyter Notebook (Main Project)
* environment.yaml          - Environment for the project
* requirements.txt          - Incase you don't you conda
* model.py                  - Neural Network for the project
* Bike-Sharing-Dataset      - Dataset for the project (UCI Machine Learning Database).
