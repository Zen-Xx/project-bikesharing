# project-bikesharing

Imagine that you own a bikesharing company. You want to predict how many bikes you need because if you have too few you're loosing money from potential riders. You are wasting money on bikes that are just sitting around. So you need to predict from historical data how many bikes you'll need in the future.

To do this we'll use a simple two layer neural network.
